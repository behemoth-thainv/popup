    <h1>My Headingaaaa</h1>
    <p>My paragraph.</p>
    <p>
      This Japanese Lorem Ipsum is based on the kanji frequency count at
      tidraso.co.uk and includes about 50% kanji, 25% hiragana, 20% katakana and
      5% roman numerals and punctuation. Katakana and hiragana cluster in
      strings between 1 to 4 chars at random points in each paragraph. Hiragana
      occurs more often at the end of sentences, rather in clumps of 1 to 4
      chars rather than just single chars. Katakana is very unlikely to appear
      as a single character in Japanese text, but hiragana could. Exclamation
      and question marks are "double-byte", not standard ascii ones. Suggestions
      for improvements or alternatives are welcome.
    </p>
