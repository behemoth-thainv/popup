        This Japanese Lorem Ipsum is based on the kanji frequency count at
        tidraso.co.uk and includes about 50% kanji, 25% hiragana, 20% katakana
        and 5% roman numerals and punctuation. Katakana and hiragana cluster in
        strings between 1 to 4 chars at random points in each paragraph.
        Hiragana occurs more often at the end of sentences, rather in clumps of
        1 to 4 chars rather than just single chars. Katakana is very unlikely to
        appear as a single character in Japanese text, but hiragana could.
        Exclamation and question marks are "double-byte", not standard ascii
        ones. Suggestions for improvements or alternatives are welcome.
